Dump of assembler code for function phase_1:
   0x0000000000400f2d <+0>:	sub    $0x8,%rsp        ; Allocate 8 bytes on the stack for local variables or alignment.
   0x0000000000400f31 <+4>:	mov    $0x4026f0,%esi   ; Load the address 0x4026f0 into the ESI register.
                                                   ; This address likely points to the secret target string.
                                                   ; ESI will serve as the second argument to strings_not_equal 
   0x0000000000400f36 <+9>:	call   0x401473 <strings_not_equal> ; Call the strings_not_equal function.
                                                   ; This function compares two strings.
                                                   ; The first string (user input) is expected in RDI (set by the calling function, e.g., main's read_line).
                                                   ; The second string (the target) is passed in ESI (0x4026f0).
                                                   ; It returns 0 in EAX if strings are equal, non-zero if not equal.
   0x0000000000400f3b <+14>:	test   %eax,%eax      ; Perform a bitwise AND of EAX with itself.
                                                   ; This instruction sets the CPU flags, particularly the Zero Flag (ZF),
                                                   ; based on the value in EAX. If EAX is 0, ZF is set.
   0x0000000000400f3d <+16>:	je     0x400f44 <phase_1+23> ; Jump if Equal (ZF is set).
                                                   ; If EAX was 0 (meaning strings_not_equal returned 0, i.e., strings were equal),
                                                   ; execution jumps to address 0x400f44, bypassing the explode_bomb call.

                                                   ; meaning the strings were NOT equal (EAX was non-zero), causing the bomb to "explode."
   0x0000000000400f44 <+23>:	add    $0x8,%rsp      ; Deallocate the 8 bytes previously allocated on the stack at <+0>.
                                                   ; This restores the stack pointer to its state before the function call.
   0x0000000000400f48 <+27>:	ret                   ; Return from the phase_1 function to the caller.
